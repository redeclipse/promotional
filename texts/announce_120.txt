Red Eclipse v1.2 (Cosmic Edition) is out now. With it we have brought an amazing list of changes, additions, and bug fixes; many of which were inspired by community input and poll results. Over the last year, we have seen our community grow and flourish, along with which the quality of the game has increased greatly. We'd like to thank everyone who played a part in making this our best release yet, and we hope you enjoy it as much as we did creating it.
